  # cat=basic/enable/220;             type=options[Yes: website dosn't contain private content,No]; label=Exclude fe_group controlling: Simplify backend forms! If you have a website without a fe_user administration, you don't need the fe_group controlling field in backend forms. This option marks it in organiser tables 'excluded'. This has an effect for editors and it hasn't any effect for administrators.

  # cat=basic/enable/240;             type=options[Yes,No]; label=Top News as checkbox: Simplify backend forms! 'Yes' reduces the field `Top news` (table `News`) to a checkbox. 'No' means the field `Top news` is a select box with priorities. This has an effect for both editors and administrators.

  # cat=basic/enable/930;             type=options[Easy 1: all in the same directory,Easy 2: same as easy 1 but with storage pid,Clear presented: each record group in one directory at most,Multi grouped: record groups in different directories]; label=Store record configuration: [Easy]: less configuration costs. If you want to link from one record to another, both have to be stored in the same directory. It may be confusing in case of a lot of data. [Clear presented]: each record group has its own directory. I.e. fe_users are in [staff], events are in [calendar]. Disadvantage: you have to configure page TSconfig and you will have some wizards without an add icon and without an list icon. [Multi grouped]: Same like [clear presented], but record groups can have more than one directory. It enables sophisticated access rules. See section "FAQ: Store record configuration" in the manual.

This is the TYPO3 default. [Managed by general record storage page (not recommended)] If you like to see only fe_groups of a special folder, you can configure it in the page properties with the field "general record storage page". [Managed by page TSconfig (ID)] If you like to see only fe_groups of a special folder, you can configure it in the page TSconfig with the property PAGE_TSCONFIG_ID. [Managed by page TSconfig (list)] If you like to see only fe_groups of a special folder, you can configure it in the page TSconfig with the property PAGE_TSCONFIG_IDLIST.

   # cat=basic/enable/932;            type=options[Yes (recommended),No]; label=Full wizard support: If full wizard support is enabled, main records will have all three icons for their category records: edit, add and list. This is best usability. But you have to store category records in the same directory like the main records. You have to rough it, if there are needs to store categories in other directories. This property has only an effect in case of store records [clear presented] or [multi grouped].
